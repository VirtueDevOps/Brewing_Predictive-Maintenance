# Brewing Predictive Maintenance Template

Welcome to the Brewing Predictive Maintenance Template! This repository contains a template that you can use to build and deploy a Python machine learning model designed to perform predictive maintenance on beer brewing equipment. This could be particularly useful if your brewing setup is coupled with Johnson Controllers or other similar sensors and equipment.

## How to Use

Here is a structured approach to building and deploying your predictive maintenance solution:

### 1. Collect and Preprocess Data

Start by collecting and preparing data from various sources, such as sensors on the brewing equipment, maintenance logs, and production data. You'll need to clean and transform this data to make it suitable for training a machine learning model.

```python
# Replace this code with your data collection and preprocessing steps
```

### 2. Explore and Visualize the Data

Explore and visualize the data to identify patterns, potential features, and challenges. This step helps in understanding the data better and identifying features useful for training the model.

```python
# Replace this code with your data exploration and visualization steps
```

### 3. Select a Machine Learning Algorithm

After understanding the data in depth, select a machine learning algorithm suitable for your specific needs. This choice largely depends on the data characteristics and the problem at hand.

```python
# Replace this code with your algorithm selection steps
```

### 4. Train and Evaluate the Model

Utilize your data to train the model and subsequently evaluate its performance using suitable metrics such as accuracy and F1 score. Hyperparameter tuning might be necessary at this stage to optimize the model's performance.

```python
# Replace this code with your model training and evaluation steps
```

### 5. Deploy the Model

After achieving satisfactory performance on the training data, deploy the model to a production environment. Integration might involve inserting it into the brewing equipment's control system or developing a standalone application.

```python
# Replace this code with your model deployment steps
```

### 6. Monitor and Maintain the Model

Post-deployment, regularly monitor the model's performance to ensure it remains effective over time. You might need to retrain it periodically using fresh data.

```python
# Replace this code with your monitoring and maintenance steps
```

## Conclusion

This template serves as a starting point for developing a predictive maintenance system. Customize it by adding specifics about your setup, including details about controllers, sensors, and other necessary data preprocessing steps. Happy brewing and coding!
